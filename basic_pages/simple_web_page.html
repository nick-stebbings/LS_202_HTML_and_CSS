        <h1>Hello, Internet!</h1>
        <p>
          Welcome to my website! It's a work in progress as I learn
          <strong>HTML</strong> and <strong>CSS</strong> from a
          <em>terrific</em> class I'm taking at
          <a href="https://launchschool.com" target="_blank">Launch School</a>.
          I'm learning a lot! Why don't you join me?
        </p>

        <p class="secondary-p">
          There's not a lot of material on this page as I'm playing around with
          HTML & CSS. When I'm done, these last two paragraphs will take on a
          lighter color than the first - the "class" attribute on the two
          &lt;p&gt; tags and a bit of CSS will help that.
        </p>

        <p class="secondary-p" id="last-para">
          This is the final paragraph. It also uses the `class` attribute as
          well as an `id` attribute. We'll use some CSS and the `id` attribute
          to underline the entire paragraph.
